HTML Personal Portfolio Website Assignment
Description:
Provide a brief overview of the assignment. Explain the objective, key tasks, and any relevant background information.
This assignment was to understand HTML5 and implement proper document structures. Also, it was to understand organizing and listing.

Approach / What I Did:
Describe your approach to building the HTML structure. Explain design choices, layout decisions, and how elements are structured.
 First I needed to create a program that shows my profile picture. After this section, I needed to create the “Navigation Link” section. This is the section where it will take you to a specific section easily. After this section, I needed to create the “About Me” section. For this section, I introduced myself and wrote a little background about myself. After this section, I needed to create the “Experience” section. This section is where I needed to list my experiences of coding. After this section, I needed to create the “Education” section. This is the section where I must show what school I have attended.  After this section, I needed to create the “Skills” section. This is the section where I must show what languages I can code. After this section, I needed to add the “Project” section. This is the section where I needed to list my projects so far. After this section, I needed to create the “Audio” section. This was for practice and it is a section that will play the audio that I added.” After this section, I needed to create the “Contact” section. This is the section where I needed to add my GitHub link. After this section, I needed to create the “Footer” section. This is the section where I needed to put my name. Finally, I needed to create the “General Styles” section. This is the section where it will align everything perfectly. 


Code Explanation:
A key part of my project is this.
<!-- Navigation Section -->
<nav>
    <ul class="nav-links">
        <li><a href="#about-me">About Me</a></li>
        <li><a href="#experience">Experience</a></li>
        <li><a href="#education">Education</a></li>
        <li><a href="#projects">Projects</a></li>

Here, I have created my navigation links. It will go to the specific section easily.

Another key part of my project was this.
<!-- Audio -->
<audio controls>
    <source src="https://www.soundhelix.com/examples/mp3/SoundHelix-Song-1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
This was a practice to add an audio. By adding this code, it will play the audio that I have added.
